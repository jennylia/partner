# Partners
Partners is an app that lets you find study partners in real time.
Current deployed version: http://partners2015.mybluemix.net/

This app is completely opensourced! Perfect place if you want to start learning and exploring Meteor.

## How the app works (User work flow)
First things first, sign up and create a profile. Once you created the profile, you can browse to see all other users' profiles. If you like someone, click "like". If the other person likes you back, you guys will be matched as study partners. You and your study partners can have your private chat rooms, or go to "Topics" page to have a discussion about topics with others.
